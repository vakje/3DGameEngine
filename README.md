# "3D Game Engine"

Project that is in progress.

## Current state

- For now I have implemented basic stuff like input system, rendering, math classes.  
- It is my personal dicision to write math classes from scratch, With a foundational background in Calculus II and Linear Algebra from university,
  I'm looking to deepen my understanding of the mathematics essential for game engines and 3D game development. 
- My rendering class can visually display simple .obj files created in Blender or other 3D modeling software. It has simple graphics pipeline
  that allows my program to create 3D models with indicies and verticies.
  this class also has simple glsl file parser to use shaders for coloring or math calculations.


  ## Demo

Hereâ€™s what the renderer looks like in action:
